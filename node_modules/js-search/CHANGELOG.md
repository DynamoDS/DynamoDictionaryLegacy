# Changelog

## 1.3.3
Fixed a bug in `TfIdfSearchIndex` that caused errors when indexing certain reserved keywords (eg "constructor").

## 1.3.2
Fixed tokenizer bug affecting IE <= 10 that caused prefix and substring token strategies incorrectly index terms.

## 1.3.1
Replaced `array.push.call` with `array.concat` in `addDocuments`.
This avoids potential stack overflow for large documents arrays.

## 1.3.0
`Search.addIndex` supports `Array` parameter for nested values.
`Search` indexing supports non-string values (eg numbers).
Special thanks to @konradjurk for this release.

## 1.2.1
Modified export to better support Node environment (thanks to @scommisso).

## 1.2.0
