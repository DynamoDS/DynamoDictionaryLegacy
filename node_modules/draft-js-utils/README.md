# Collection of utilities for DraftJS

This is a set of utilities originally built for [React-RTE](https://react-rte.org/), a rich text editor built on the awesome [DraftJS](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js).

# Development

This project uses [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) for static type checking. The type annotations are optional, but preferred. Each file can opt-in to using Flow by adding `@flow` to the docblock or put this as the first line: `/* @flow */`.

Flow typechecks will be run as part of the normal tests `npm run test` but can also be run separately using `npm run typecheck`.
