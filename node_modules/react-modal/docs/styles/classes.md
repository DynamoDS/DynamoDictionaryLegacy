### CSS Classes

Sometimes it may be preferable to use CSS classes rather than inline styles.  You can use the `className` and `overlayClassName` props to specify a given CSS class for each of those.
Note: If you provide those props all default styles will not be applied, leaving all styles under control of the CSS class.
The `portalClassName` can also be used however there are no styles by default applied
